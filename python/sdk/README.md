## OpenReality SDK
This is Python-based SDK for the OpenReality headset project. Documentation is work in progress, however this SDK allows the following: \
- [ ] Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
  - [ ] Image transfer
  - [ ] Accelerometer data transfer

This framework is based on the UNIX sockets and works correctly only on Linux machines.
